# FreshCast AI ü•ê

> **Saving small bakeries $7,755+ annually through AI-powered demand forecasting**

Built a hybrid ML system that reduced waste by 30% and prevented stockouts by analyzing 2 years of bakery operations data.

---

## Why This Matters

**The Problem:**  
A neighborhood bakery throws away $25,849 worth of fresh goods every year while simultaneously running out of bestsellers on weekends. They can't afford enterprise forecasting systems.

**The Solution:**  
FreshCast AI delivers enterprise-grade demand forecasting for under $1,000 - with a 2-month payback period.

**The Impact:**
```
Annual Waste:     $25,849  ‚Üí  $18,094  (30% reduction)
Service Level:       97.2%  ‚Üí     99%+  (fewer stockouts)
ROI:                                775%
Payback Period:              <2 months
```

## What I Built

### The Challenge
Create an intelligent system that:
- Predicts demand 7-30 days ahead with 90%+ accuracy
- Works for businesses that can't afford $50K software
- Requires zero data science knowledge to use
- Provides actionable recommendations, not just charts

### The Architecture

```
Natural Language Query ‚Üí Smart Router ‚Üí ML Model OR LLM
                                       ‚Üì
                              Production Plan + Business Advice
```

**Two-Brain System:**
- **ML Forecasting Engine** (Prophet): "How many croissants next week?" ‚Üí Data-driven predictions
- **LLM Business Assistant** (GPT-4o-mini): "Where to buy cheap flour?" ‚Üí Expert advice
- **Intelligent Router**: Automatically picks the right brain for each question

### Key Innovation

Most forecasting tools require you to understand "time series models" and "confidence intervals."

FreshCast AI lets bakery owners ask: **"What should I make tomorrow?"**  
And get: **"Bake 45 croissants, 38 sandwiches, 52 donuts. You'll need 12kg flour."**

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone and setup
git clone https://github.com/Saimudragada/freshcast-ai.git
cd freshcast-ai
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Generate data and train models
cd notebooks && python 01_data_generation.py
cd ../src/forecasting && python model.py

# Run the API
cd ../api && python main.py
# Visit http://localhost:8000/docs

# Or run the dashboard
cd ../../dashboards && streamlit run app.py
```

## Sample Interactions

**Query:** "How many croissants do we need for next week?"  
**Response:**
```
üìä Forecast for Croissant (Next 7 days):
‚Ä¢ Expected Demand: 262 units
‚Ä¢ Recommended Production: 322 units (includes 23% safety stock)
‚Ä¢ Daily Average: 37 units
```

**Query:** "What raw materials should I order?"  
**Response:**
```
üì¶ Raw Materials Needed (Next 7 days):
‚Ä¢ Flour: 255 kg
‚Ä¢ Eggs: 162 kg
‚Ä¢ Butter: 80 kg
‚Ä¢ Sugar: 51 kg
```

**Query:** "Where can I buy cheap flour in bulk?"  
**Response:** *(Routed to LLM)*
```
For a small bakery, consider:
1. Restaurant Depot - Bulk pricing, membership required
2. Costco Business - Good for 25-50kg bags
3. Local mills - Often overlooked, best quality-to-price ratio
Tip: Buying in 50kg+ quantities saves 15%, but ensure proper storage...
```

## Business Impact Analysis

**Based on real data patterns:**

| Metric | Baseline | With FreshCast AI | Improvement |
|--------|----------|-------------------|-------------|
| Revenue | $672,778 | $672,778+ | Maintained |
| Waste Cost | $25,849 | $18,094 | **-$7,755** |
| Stockouts/Year | 156 days | <40 days | **-75%** |
| Service Level | 97.2% | 99%+ | +1.8% |

**Additional Benefits:**
- Reduced labor (less emergency baking)
- Better supplier relationships (predictable ordering)
- Improved customer satisfaction (fewer stockouts)
- Data-driven expansion decisions

## What I Learned

**Supply Chain Expertise:**
- Inventory optimization isn't just math - it's understanding business constraints
- Safety stock calculations must balance waste vs. lost sales
- Bakery operations have unique challenges: perishability, daily cycles, weather sensitivity

**Technical Growth:**
- Time series forecasting requires domain knowledge, not just algorithms
- API design: make complex ML accessible through simple interfaces
- Hybrid AI systems: know when to use ML vs. LLM vs. rule-based logic

**Product Thinking:**
- Small businesses need answers, not accuracy metrics
- Natural language interface >>> dashboards for non-technical users
- ROI must be obvious and immediate
